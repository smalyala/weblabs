	<center><h1>My Summer</h1></center>
	<p>During the second week of summer, I went up to Philadelphia to attend a cultural convention that lasted three days. The program included dances, concerts, contests, etc. The highlight was undoubtedly when I met Miss America 2014.</p>
	<p>Towards the end of summer, I visited Cancun with a few friends. We stopped by the popular excursions and had a blast there. Also, we resided in a resort that had all the amenities we could ask for. We even met a few other teenagers from Canada. Cancun is definitely a place I will revisit.</p>
